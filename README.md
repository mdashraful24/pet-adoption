Project Name: Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform.

Description: In this project, I developed a Pet Adoption website that retrieves data from a server and dynamically presents the available pets to users. The application is designed with various functionalities, such as displaying pets in different categories (e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits), and allows users to sort the pets based on their price. Each pet is displayed in a card format with key information such as the pet's image, breed, age, and gender. Users can interact with the pet cards, and the website offers additional features like modals for pet adoption confirmations.

Five key features of the project:

    • Dynamic Categories
    • Detailed Information Visualization
    • Option to be Like and Adopt
    • Loading Spinner
    • Handle Null or Undefined Values

ES6 features used:

    • Arrow Functions
    • Destructuring Assignment
    • Template Literals
    • Promises
    • Let and Const Keywords
